h3. About

p. iFilger is a very minimal buff/debuff tracking addon that will allow you to track buffs/debuffs on yourself, target, pets, focus, etc, and also can be used to track cooldowns.

p. Buffs/debuffs/cooldowns/internal-cooldown can be displayed as both bars and icons, and stack sizes and durations will be shown.

p. Only the buffs/debuffs/cooldowns you want will be displayed, the addon uses a white-list system and you have to tell it exactly what you want it to show. 

p. The default config is VERY bar/icon spammy, you'll probably want to go through and comment out a bunch of stuff for a usable setup.

h3. What's next ? 

p. Find the reason why buffs doesn't appears in the order defined in config.lua, that might be usefull for class gameplay works with DoTs or Buffs to keep active.
Try to make an ingame config ui, but I don't realy know how, so don't expect that mutch.
Slash Command need some reworks


h3. WARNING

p. WIP in iFilger_ConfigUI, if you don't want LUA ERROR, DO NOT ENABLE IT ! I can't play WoW ATM, so i'm blind coding and i can't check if my code works or not.

p. It seams the memory used by the addon still increase slowly during long fight and come back to normal value at the end. There may be a small memory leak and i can't find that b**** again >_<
