h3. About

p. iFilger is a very minimal buff/debuff tracking addon that will allow you to track buffs/debuffs on yourself, target, pets, focus, etc, and also can be used to track cooldowns.

p. Buffs/debuffs/cooldowns/internal-cooldown can be displayed as both bars and icons, and stack sizes and durations will be shown.

p. Only the buffs/debuffs/cooldowns you want will be displayed, the addon uses a white-list system and you have to tell it exactly what you want it to show. 

p. The default config is VERY bar/icon spammy, you'll probably want to go through and comment out a bunch of stuff for a usable setup.

h3. What's next ? 

p. ConfigUI must be done so it recognise if new sub sections have been added or deleted. That way reset should *not* be mandatory.
Adding a *Merge With* option, because having 3 times the same name (Cooldown), you don't realy know what is in that sub section (ICD or racials ?).

p. Localisation is done, but German, Spanish and others versions are needed. If you feel like helping me, i would gladly appreciate it !
